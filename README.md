Today, I have learned a bit on how to GitHub and that the site is highly used by developers. Including that it is also used as a cloud storage like Google Drive, but it stores code in it. Another thing is that computers can't think things like people do, which reminded me what I was told at college is that computers are only as smart as peolpe make them.

I have learned what should and should not be included in the documents we submit for the course, such as the programming journal is not a diary as it should not include how our day was and the tutorials should be written in an understandable way that is not copying anyone. All while using Github in markdown (.md) format, save for the task log which will be made using spreadsheet software.

Another thing is that the libeary folder and the .vdCode is not needed for the submission of our work, as the library folder is large and deleting it will save a lot of memory. An additional thing is that there is a Unity function called .MoveTowards which can be used to make one object home in on a targeted object like a missle and the speed can be determined to your preferences.

I have relearned how to create the editor script to make all 2D sprites that get put into a specific folder turn into sprites automatically so they do not need to be changed manually without it. While doing this, I also learned how to write a tutorial using Github using the same markdown (.md) format as last time. Another thing I figured out is that the curly brackets ({}) are used as high lights as it makes a box containing what wal written in it.

I have learned how to write code in Unity to make an AI character move wherever the mouse is clicked when the game is playing. While doing this, I asked the tr=eacher whether or not they should always involve code and Paul said that all the tutorials I make must involve code in them, or at least have something that refers to a currently existing component.
